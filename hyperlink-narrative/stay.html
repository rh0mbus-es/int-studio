      <!--euridice-->
      the echoes of your husband's songs follow behind as you turn away and move further into the Underground. <br> <br>
      you walk. <br>
      and walk. <br>
      and walk. <br> <br>
      until you can hear the whisper of a river, getting louder as you approach. <br><br>
      as you reach the banks of the river, frothy and whirling, you see a robed figure standing alone, lantern held aloft. <br>
      it turns to face you, beckons you aboard its boat, a rickety thing of dark wood. you know him like you knew yourself. <br><br>
      charon escorts you to <a href = "euridice2.html">the other side.</a>
