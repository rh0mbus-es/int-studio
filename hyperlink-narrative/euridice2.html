        it isn't as cold as you feared, down here. <br>
        the other souls whirl around you, each moving aimlessly between destinations. <br><br>
        you let yourself drift along with them. you're already dead, what's the point of being upset about...<BR>
            what were you upset about? something... warm. a hand in yours.<BR>
        it doesn't matter anymore. <br><BR>
        your eyes find the king of shades sitting high above you, imposing and grand. <br><br>
        you let yourself drift <a href = "hades-e.html">toward him.</a><br>
        you let yourself <a href = "drifting-e.html">drift.</a>
