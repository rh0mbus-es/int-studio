        months pass. you sing ugly, hateful songs to the vultures that follow behind you.<br>
        spring fades into summer, which is harshly cut off by fall. <br>
        you never stay in one place long enough to watch the seasons change. <br><br>
        until one day, the last vestiges of autumn fading into winter, you hear the dialect of the gods. <br><br>
