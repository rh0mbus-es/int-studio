        euridice is swept back to the underworld. <br><br>
        she waits, patiently, for orpheus to return to her. she knows he will find her again.<br>
        <br>she wishes things were different. that the story ended another way.
        <br>but how could she complain? the only thing orpheus did wrong was love her.
        <br><Br>so she drifts, waiting for him to return. 
     <!--“Eurydice, dying now a second time, uttered no complaint against her husband. What was there to complain of, but that she had been loved?”
