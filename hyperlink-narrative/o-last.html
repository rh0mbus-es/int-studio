        orpheus never sings again. <br>
        he spends the rest of his life wandering, hoping to find the entrance to hades once more.
        <br> hoping for another chance to save euridice. 
        <br> he hopes she's waiting for him, hopes he can find her.
        <br> he continues to search.
