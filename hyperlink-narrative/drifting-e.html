        you meander for a while, letting the eddys and currents of your fellow shades move you along.<br>
        the chill of the underworld settles around you, resting heavy on your shoulders and inside your chest.<br>
        you're vaguely aware of a commotion in front of you, but the quiet whispers of the souls around you take over your senses. <br><br>
        you don't notice the human approach you until he rests his hand on your shoulder.<br>
        he looks at you with intensity, concern. says your name. <br>
        it all comes back to you. orpheus! how quickly has the underworld made you forget!<br><br>
        you reach out to him and <a href = "reunite.html">reunite.</a>
