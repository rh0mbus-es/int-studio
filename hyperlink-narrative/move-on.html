      <!--orpheus-->
      you feel something in your soul shred apart. <br><br>
      your muse, your heart, your everything. <br>
      your euridice. <br><br>
      swallowed up by the ground. <br>
      the song bubbles up from your chest like the tide, scathing, vitriolic. the grass withers away as you sing. <br><br>
      you do not turn back as you <a href = "orpheus2.html">leave</a>, as if that would change the outcome. as if that would let her come with you.

    </h1>
