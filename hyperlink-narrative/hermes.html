       hermes stands in front of you, resplendent as all the gods are. <br><br>
       <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">"Why Do You Sing So Tragically, Poet?"</p><br>
       through your awe and grief, you manage to explain to hermes what has happened. <br>
       he looks at you coolly, as if carved from marble. <br><br>
       <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">"I Know How To Enter Hades. Convince Me That You Are Worthy Of This Knowledge And I Shall Pass It Unto You."</p><br>
       your breath catches in your chest.
